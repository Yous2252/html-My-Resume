        <h2>Web Developer</h2>
        <p>
            Hey there! I'm Yousef, a self-taught web developer with a passion for crafting awesome digital experiences. You see, my journey into web development wasn't your traditional one. I didn't have a fancy degree hanging on my wall. Instead, I rolled up my sleeves, dove headfirst into online tutorials, and taught myself the ins and outs of coding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through countless late nights and a whole lot of trial and error, I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. I've built websites from scratch, and tinkered with frameworks like Bootstrap and React.
        </p>
        <p class="description">What sets me apart? Well, besides my love for a good challenge, I bring a fresh perspective to the table. My journey as a self-taught developer has taught me the importance of creativity, resilience, and thinking outside the box.</p>
